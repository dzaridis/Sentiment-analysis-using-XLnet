# Sentiment-analysis-using-XLnet
Abstract
In this paper sentiment analysis has been performed in order to evaluate the performance
of XLNet on this particular task. XLNet is rather a ground-breaking network on language
understanding which uses the perks of both autoregressive models and autoencoders. While
BERT uses autoencoders and Transformers use autoregression, XLNet combines the aforementioned networksâ€™ attributes in order to achieve higher performance in many NLP tasks,
such as sentiment analysis, question answering, reading comprehension, natural language
understanding etc. In this work we evaluate the XLNet model in several sentiment classification tasks in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The XLNet reaches state of the art results
and outperforms BERT which is the previous state of the art model on natural language
processing.
